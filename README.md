This is a script that was made for the Picoducky YSWS event run by Hack Club.
Disclaimer: This does uses the python keyboard and mouse libraries. I do not have a picoducky nor a raspberry pi. This also only works with Windows computers when the Settings window and Notepad window is NOT in fullscreen.

What it does:
This script is pretty simple. It pulls up peak music for you to listen to while is updates your computer, activates automatic updates, and activates various privacy settings.
